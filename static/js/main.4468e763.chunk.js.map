The drag and drop\n        workflow is quite pleasantly simple. Let's take a look at some of\n        Tableau's best use cases, as well as how it might fit into a business's\n        workflow.

A thoughtfully designed data pipeline is the\n        difference between a static visual and a live, interactive online\n        dashboard. Pipelines address the human need to be engaged, to know and\n        respond rapidly to change, and to access information from anywhere. They\n        also often address a business's real needs best (and they're pretty cool\n        to boot).\n      </p>,\n      <p>\n        Connecting high-level components of your business can be personally\n        satisfying and empowering, as corny as that may sound.

Hosting a linked database and front end is essentially the\n        bones of a small business, which is also pretty cool to think about.

During my childhood in\n        Northeastern Pennsylvania, heart of the former anthracite coal industry,\n        the road to Grandma’s cut through one such example of local damage:\n        fields of coal spoil tips (coal is obviously not carbon-neutral\n        overall).\n      </p>,\n      <img\n        className=\"article-img\"\n        src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Coal_waste_pile_west_of_Trevorton%2C_Pennsylvania_far_shot_2.JPG\"\n      />,\n      <p>\n        Local impacts like the creation of coal spoil tips are certainly not\n        desirable. They are tolerable to most, though, in the context of a world\n        growing more prosperous overall. On the other hand, the impact of more\n        widespread or global damage, primarily global warming, makes such damage\n        unacceptable. It’s valuable to know which category of environmental\n        impacts we’re talking about when we talk about electric cars.\n      </p>,\n      <p>\n        <b>Cobalt</b>\n      </p>,\n      <p>\n        Cobalt, of which a majority is sourced from the Democratic Republic of\n        the Congo, is part of the NCA (nickel, cobalt, and aluminum) metal oxide\n        that is accommodating of lithium and stabilizes it.\n      </p>,\n      <p>\n        Nickel and cobalt are transition metals. They are very easy-come-easy-go\n        with their electrons, whereas lithium has a high tendency to lose its\n        electron. When a power source is applied to charge the lithium-ion\n        battery, the electrons from this stable side of the battery are shuttled\n        to the other side. Following their cue, the lithium leaves its stable\n        oxide home and passes through a no-electrons-permitted barrier\n        separating the two sides of the battery.\n      </p>,\n      <p>\n        Once the power is turned off, this unstable state of affairs reverses\n        itself. The lithium passes through the central layer and returns back to\n        the oxide. The electrons flow back as well but must take the outside\n        path, aka a wire, and that flow is electricity.\n      </p>,\n      <p>\n        The trouble is that while you can reduce the proportion of cobalt in the\n        NCA oxide mixture, which has been done already, you can’t get rid of it\n        completely. Cobalt has a stabilizing effect on nickel which helps\n        prevent cathode erosion and overheating. Overheating can ruin the\n        no-electrons-permitted barrier and cause the battery to explode.\n      </p>,\n      <p>\n        The necessity of cobalt, combined with the DRC’s stranglehold on supply\n        and the impossibility of tracking who mined every piece of exported\n        cobalt practically guarantees that some of it is obtained by child or\n        slave labor.\n      </p>,\n      <p>\n        <b>This post is in-progress.</b>\n      </p>,\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"uf-models\",\n    title: \"University of Florida Advancement — Modeling Team\",\n    date: \"April 16, 2021\",\n    author: \"Walter Ogozaly\",\n    tags: [\"portfolio\"],\n    content: [\n      <b>Data Description</b>,\n      <b>UF Advancement Click Data 5.35 MB</b>,\n      <p>\n        This data is in Excel format and grouped weekly. It includes the date of\n        any donor household’s first and last visits to our website as well as\n        the total number of visits. Only about 20,000 households out of ~500,000\n        have made a recorded website visit. The model will import any\n        spreadsheets that fit the click data’s naming convention so any new\n        weekly files can be simply dropped in the relevant folder.\n      </p>,\n      <b>Demographic and Alumni data (Joined_Export_*) 732 MB</b>,\n      <p>\n        The bulk of our data, representing roughly 500,000 alum households, of\n        which half have donated to UF. This data includes demographics\n        (income/region/sex/married) as well as information related to alum\n        activities and past donations.\n      </p>,\n      <b>Overall Findings</b>,\n      <p>\n        Our model identified 6,900 households with the highest propensity to\n        become first-time donors to the Machen Florida Opportunity Scholarship\n        (MFOS). A household was required to have a donation history with MFOS in\n        order to be marked as a success case in the model’s training data, so\n        these 6,900 households represent false positives identified by the\n        model. Despite this, they are the desired contact group.\n      </p>,\n      <p>\n        In order to predict who to contact for a donation in the next month, we\n        should note that we assumed you should contact the people likeliest to\n        donate. While this is a straightforward assumption, you could imagine a\n        campaign directed at medium-to-low propensity households or a campaign\n        that sought to avoid donors thought of as “safe” or “sure”. In such a\n        case our model’s utility would be significantly decreased.\n      </p>,\n      <p>\n        Two time lags were developed in order to make the most informed\n        prediction of which households would donate over the next 31 days. One\n        of these lags, formulated by looking at autocorrelation of donations\n        since 2000, was 1 year—i.e., the most predictive interval between\n        donations is 1 year, so we ought to look at April ‘20 donors when\n        predicting April ‘21 donors. The other lag was any individual donor’s\n        average MFOS donation interval. The model’s task was to identify the\n        households that met either lag condition, with the caveat of not having\n        access to ANY contact or donation variables. Forcing the model to rely\n        on donation-independent variables prevented it from eliminating\n        first-time donors on the basis of their first-time-ness, which would\n        have run counter to the business need. False positives are valuable in\n        our model output because we sought households who resembled the\n        predicted upcoming donors in all ways except having a gift history with\n        MFOS.\n      </p>,\n      <b>Code Handover</b>,\n      <p>\n        Our code is available on Github (\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/walter97/UFF_Models\">\n          https://github.com/walter97/UFF_Models\n        </a>\n        ), but since the modeling was done entirely on a virtual machine the\n        sponsor also has easy access to it via a shared folder.\n      </p>,\n    ],\n  },\n];\n\nexport default articles;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport ArticleList from \"../components/ArticleList\";\nimport articles from \"./article-content\";\n\nconst HomePage = () => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>\n        <b>Walter Ogozaly's Data Blog</b>\n      </h1>\n      <h4>\n        A place to highlight my work and document what I'm learning and doing.\n      </h4>\n      <hr />\n      <h1>\n        <b>Articles</b>\n      </h1>\n      <ArticleList articles={articles} />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default HomePage;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/me.9157d8de.png\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport profilePhoto from \"../assets/me.png\";\n\nconst AboutPage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>\n        <b>About me</b>\n      </h1>\n      <img src={profilePhoto} className=\"image--cover\" />\n      <p>\n        Hi!
